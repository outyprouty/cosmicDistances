## Course Layout
This course is broken into sections which are themselves broken into lessons.

Each section addresses a fundamental topic in the determination of cosmic distances. Each lesson builds up the knowledge needed to understand each section.

Each section culminates in a project that applies the knowledge of all of the lessons within that section.

## Lesson Components

In each lesson, you'll find any of these four components in addition to the lesson content. These complement the content in a variety of ways be explaining, giving examples, or challenging the reader.
