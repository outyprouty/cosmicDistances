I"\<p>As a note: I focus generally here on the West as a matter of pedagogy. Civilizations all around the Earth made similar and even more advanced developments in earlier times than those I’ll mention. The stories I tell here are just to motivate the following sections. I would be delighted to and, indeed, should discuss these developments in other civilizations and work them into complementary webpages.</p>
