<p>Astronomical Numbers are … well … astronomical!</p>

<p>Some Astronomical Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Average distance of the Earth from the Sun: 149,597,900 kilometers</p>

  <p>Mass of the Sun: 1,989,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilograms</p>

  <p>Age of the Earth: 4,550,000,000 years (4.55 Billion years)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some other ‘down-to-Earth’ numbers for comparison:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Number of Orea cookies sold as of 2016: 490,000,000,000</p>

  <p>US National Debt: $9,016,288,006,279.21 (as of 2007 Sept 16)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the numbers we will encounter in this course range from the very large to the very small, we need a way of dealing with such numbers sensibly. If we don’t do this, we run the risk of miscounting the number of zeros and therefore catastrophically altering final results.</p>

<h1 id="scientific-notation">Scientific Notation</h1>
<p>Scientific Notation is a compact and convenient way of expressing very large and very small numbers using powers of 10. You’ve all probably encountered scientific notation before. I hope the examples below are reminders for those who haven’t used it in a while.</p>

<p>The Mass of the Sun:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1,989,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilograms = 1.989x10<sup>30</sup> kilograms</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Diameter of a Hydrogen Atom:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>0.0000000000106 meters = 1.06x10<sup>-11</sup> meters</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Mass of a Hydrogen Nucleus (i.e., a Proton):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>0.00000000000000000000000000167 meters = 1.67x10<sup>-27</sup> kilograms</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In general, the aim of scientific notation is to re-write any number that has an absolute outside of the range \([1,9]\) and rewrite it as \(M\times10^{N}\) where \(M\) is called the coefficient and \(N\) is called the exponent. \(N\) is generally an integer.</strong></p>

<h2 id="manipulation-of-numbers-in-scientific-notation">Manipulation of Numbers in Scientific Notation</h2>
<p>Let’s try an example:</p>

<blockquote class="keypoints">
  <h2>How many times more massive is the Sun than a Hydrogen Atom?</h2>

The answer should be this ratio: $$ \frac{1,989,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000}{0.000000000000000000000000000167}$$

But ... that's gross ... And if we try the perfectly reasonable method of cancelling zeros or something like that, we're very likely to miss a zero or add one on accident!

I therefore propose we use scientific notation!

The answer is then this expression: \[ \frac{1.989\times10^{30} }{1.67\times10^{-27}} \]

This can be broken into two fractions:$$ \frac{1.989 }{1.67}\cdot\frac{10^{30} }{10^{-27}} $$

The fraction on the right is simple to reduce: $$ \frac{10^{30} }{10^{-27}} = 10^{30-(-27)} = 10^{57} $$

The fraction on the left is expressible as: $$\frac{1.989 }{1.67} = 1.191$$

We must round this number to the nearest number of significant figures, though!
The numerator has four significant figures and the denominator has three. We therefore round \( 1.191 \approx 1.19 \) .

So our final answer is that the Sun is \( 1.19\times10^{57} \) times more massive than a single hydrogen atom.

<h2 id="significant-figures">Significant Figures</h2>
<p>The number of digits used to express a measured or calculated quantity.
By using significant figures, we can show how precise a number is. If we express a number beyond the place to which we have actually measured (and are therefore certain of), we compromise the integrity of what this number is representing. It is important after learning and understanding significant figures to use them properly throughout your scientific career <a class="citation" href="#sigfigs2">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll often refer to these as ‘sig-figs’!</p>

<h2 id="significant-figure-rules">Significant Figure Rules</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Zeros within a number are always significant.
    <blockquote>
      <p>Both 4308 and 40.05 contain four significant figures.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Zeros that do nothing but set the decimal point are not significant.
    <blockquote>
      <p>470,000 has two significant figures.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Trailing zeros that aren’t needed to hold the decimal point are significant.
    <blockquote>
      <p>4.00 has three significant figures.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>If you are not sure whether a digit is significant, assume that it isn’t.
    <blockquote>
      <p>If the directions for an experiment read: “Add the sample to 400 mL of water,” assume the volume of water is known to one significant figure.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>When measurements are added or subtracted, the answer can contain no more decimal places than the least accurate measurement.
    <blockquote>
\[1.7009 + 2.0 = 3.7\]
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>When measurements are multiplied or divided, the answer can contain no more significant figures than the least accurate measurement.
    <blockquote>
\[6\times 6 = 40\]
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="precision--accuracy">Precision &amp; Accuracy</h2>
<p>Let’s introduce these ideas with an analogy of throwing a dart at a dart board. The goal is to hit the central red circle (i.e., the ‘mark’ or ‘bullseye’).</p>

<p>Hitting the same spot with each throw makes your aim precise.</p>

<p>If the spot you hit is the mark, then you are accurate and precise.</p>

<p>Hitting many different spots with each successive throw is imprecise.</p>

<p>If the average of those spots is the mark, you may still be accurate.</p>

  <p>Precision: A measure of how closely individual measurements agree with one another.</p>
