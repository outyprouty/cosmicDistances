The metric system or International System of Units to discuss all quantities they work with. In French this is "Système international d'unités" or the SI system. At present, only the United States, Liberia & Myanmar (aka Burma) have not adopted SI units as their primary system of units.

The basic units of the metric system are:
1. length measured in meters (m)
2. mass measured in kilograms (kg)
3. time measured in seconds (s)

For more on SI units, follow this citation: {% cite nist %}.

This means that we will always express measurements in these units!

Yes, even if the number is astronomically large! This is where we will employ scientific notation!

| ----------- | ----------- | -----------|
| Factor | Prefix | Examples |
| ----------- | ----------- | -----------|
|$$10^3$$	      |kilo-	|kilogram, kilometer, kilobyte
|$$10^6$$	      |mega-	|megawatt, megayear, megabyte, megaton
|$$10^9$$	      |giga-	|gigayear, gigaton, gigabyte
|$$10^{12}$$	     |tera-	    |terawatt, terabyte
|$$10^{-2}$$	|centi-	    |centimeter
|$$10^{-3}$$	     |milli-	|millimeter, millisecond, milliliter
|$$10^{-6}$$	     |micro-	|microsecond, micron
|$$10^{-9}$$	     |nano-	    |nanosecond, nanometer
| ----------- | ----------- | -----------|

### Common Examples

Length:
>1 kilometer = $$10^{3}$$ meters (1000 meters)
>
>1 centimeter = $$10^{-2}$$ meters (1/100th of a meter)
>
>1 millimeter = $$10^{-3}$$ meters (1/1000th of a meter)
>
>1 micron = $$10^{-6}$$ meters (short for "micrometer")

Time:
>1 nanosecond = $$10^{-9}$$ seconds (1 billionth of a second)
>
>1 gigayear (Gy) = $$10^{9}$$ years (1 Billion years)
>
>1 megayear (My) = $$10^{6}$$ years (1 Million years)
