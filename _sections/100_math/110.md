# Big numbers
Astronomical Numbers are ... well ... astronomical!

Some Astronomical Examples:
> Average distance of the Earth from the Sun: 149,597,900 kilometers
>
> Mass of the Sun: 1,989,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilograms
>
> Age of the Earth: 4,550,000,000 years (4.55 Billion years)

Some other 'down-to-Earth' numbers for comparison:
> Number of OREO cookies sold as of 2016: 490,000,000,000
>
> US National Debt: $9,016,288,006,279.21 (as of 2007 Sept 16)


Because the numbers we will encounter in this course range from the very large to the very small, we need a way of dealing with such numbers sensibly. If we don't do this, we run the risk of miscounting the number of zeros and therefore catastrophically altering final results.

# Scientific Notation
Scientific Notation is a compact and convenient way of expressing very large and very small numbers using powers of 10. You've all probably encountered scientific notation before. I hope the examples below are reminders for those who haven't used it in a while.

The Mass of the Sun:
> 1,989,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilograms = 1.989x10<sup>30</sup> kilograms

The Size of a Hydrogen Atom:
0.0000000000106 meters = 1.06x10<sup>-11</sup> meters

In each case, use of scientific notation eliminates most of the zeros which are just place-holders for factors of ten, letting us concentrate on the significant figures. In a field such as astronomy that deals with scales ranging from subatomic particles to the entire universe, this notation is a great simplification!

In general, the aim of scientific notation is to re-write any number that has an absolute outside of the range {% katex %}
c = \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
{% endkatex %}
